# Life cycle prediction on commercial cells

In this project, we are recreating a small portion of the work done in Severson, et al.'s 2019 work "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before
capacity degradation". We are building models, in the "notebooks" folder. First, I have created two linear regression models to predict cycle life, and I'm currently constructing a classifier to sort into high and low cycle life categories, but it has not been posted yet. 

In order to follow along, you will need to download their data (in batches) from https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204 and then use the pkl files from https://github.com/rdbraatz/data-driven-prediction-of-battery-cycle-life-before-capacity-degradation to load the data. 

I saved the data and the pkl files in my "data" folder, but I ignored the contents of this folder when creating this repo, due it being too large.
